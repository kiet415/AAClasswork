Objectives - CSS Reset, display (block, inline, inline-block, flex)


CSS Reset
To make sure we apply styles to our website, we get the same style for
different internet browsers that will overwrite all built in
styles.

Have a boiler plate and just c/p it. 


Display - types of boxes
    - block
    - inline
    - inline-block
    - *flex

block <div>
    Tries to be as wide as possible
    content before and after box appears on seperate line 
    Can have any other element as child.

Inline <span>
    Allows other elements to its left and right
    cannot have a width and height set 
    doesnt respect top/bottom  margin/padding

Inline-block 
    Allows other elements to its left and right
    Respect width/height, and margin/padding (including top/bottom)

Float
    Useful for making a print design layout (Like a newspaper)
    left,right,none
    clear: left, right, none, both
    Removed from normal flow of page, but things "float" around it (still in flow)
    
Clearfix
    if a floating element is "floating" outside of its container this its a clearfix

Flex   
    If there is one css skill to master, this is it
    goes onn the container to affect the layout of the children
    main idea is to give the container the ability to alter it's children
        placement and order to best fill available space
    Intended to be a more flexible way of managing the content position
        and size on a site.

    *Use justify-content for location along main axis  (center, flex-start,flex-end )
    *align-items work along cross axis (stretch, center, flex-start,flex-end)
    *flex direction for direction main axis (row, column)
