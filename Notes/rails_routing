MVC OVERVIEW


HTTP Methods
GET (get something from db)
POST (insert something into DB)
PATCH/PUT (change something in DB)
DELETE  (remove something from DB)


COMPONENETS OF HTTP RESPONSE
    Status (e.g 200,302,404)
        - indicates type of response (successful or not)
    Body (e.g actual HTML document or data formatted as JASON)
        -actual data/content  the server responded with

RAILS ROUTER
    Takes in HTTP Requests, decides where to send them
    Router instantiates an instance of a controller and 
    involes an action on that controller

REST:Reprensentation State Transfer
    REST is a standardized way to interpret an http Requests
    and extrapolate the desired response from the server



CHIRP Routes EXAMPLE
get "/chirps", to: "chirps#index"
post "/chirps", to: "chirps#create"
get "/chirps/:id", to: "chirps#show"
patch "/chirps/:id", to: "chirps#update"
delete "/chirps/:id", to: "chirps#destroy"



Controller - Takes in HTTP Requests, decides what to do with them   
            and how to respond 
    Controllers work with models and views to populate 

Params - three ways to pass params in HTTP Request 
    -wildcards inside a Route 
    -via the query string 
    -inside the Body

SETTING UP Controllers
class UsersController < ApplicationController   (ALWAYS PLURAL)
